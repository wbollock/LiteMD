Docker Image Planning, Findings, and Notes:

Commands:

# Create Alpine Linux in background and keep it going (detached)
sudo docker run -dit --name alpine alpine:latest 

# Access Alpine Linux container
sudo docker exec -it alpine sh
    Findings: wget installed, cron good to go. 



Thoughts on what I'll need:
# 2 volumes
1. /etc/motd
possibly mount host system /etc/motd into some dir (could be /etc/motd maybe)

Issues: how the hell do I mount a volume on a container I make


2. user specified directory (virusDir)
I guess mount the entire directory the user wants to scan for viruses? Idk how else to give docker Access

Processes:
run cron inside container, target being user specified volume

run litemd on stuff, output to /etc/motd. i think that'll be fine
when testing add a line like

Other Thoughts:
might be easiest to have script run with $1 as virusDir and $2 as /etc/motd path
I could in theory do this in docker

easiest to not give user ANY choice besides MOTD and specified directory to scan for malware

seperate version of litemd.sh for docker?
